1b - Installation instructions detailed

* copy <path_to_dia-eipshapes>/shapes/Integration dir to <path_to_dia>/shapes

* copy <path_to_dia-eipshapes>/sheets/eip.sheet to <path_to_dia>/sheets


An example:

If ubuntu and dia installed with apt-get you'll probably find dia in /usr/share/dia
Let's say eip-shapes is located in ~/dia-eipshapes

* $ sudo cp -r  ~/dia-eipshapes/shapes/Integration /usr/share/dia/shapes 
* $ sudo cp   ~/dia-eipshapes/sheets/eip.sheet /usr/share/dia/sheets
